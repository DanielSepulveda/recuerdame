# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature completes the Clerk authentication implementation for the Recuerdame app, enabling users to sign in and sign up to create and manage their digital altars. While the basic Clerk infrastructure is already configured, we need to implement user-facing authentication flows using Clerk's built-in components displayed in dialogs when users attempt to access the app.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a new visitor, I want to sign up for an account so that I can create and manage my own digital altars.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks "Crear Mi Altar" on the landing page THEN the system SHALL open a sign-up dialog with Clerk's SignUp component
2. WHEN a user accesses the sign-up dialog THEN the system SHALL display Clerk's built-in sign-up form with Spanish localization
3. WHEN a user successfully completes sign-up THEN the system SHALL close the dialog and redirect them to the protected app dashboard
4. WHEN a user provides invalid sign-up information THEN Clerk SHALL display appropriate error messages
5. IF a user already has an account THEN Clerk's component SHALL provide a link to switch to the sign-in flow

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a returning user, I want to sign in to my account so that I can access my existing altars and create new ones.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user needs to sign in THEN the system SHALL display Clerk's SignIn component in a dialog
2. WHEN a user enters valid credentials THEN Clerk SHALL authenticate them and the system SHALL redirect to the app dashboard
3. WHEN a user enters invalid credentials THEN Clerk SHALL display appropriate error messages
4. WHEN a user attempts to access protected routes while unauthenticated THEN the system SHALL open the sign-in dialog
5. IF a user doesn't have an account THEN Clerk's component SHALL provide a link to switch to the sign-up flow

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the authentication experience to feel integrated with the Day of the Dead theme so that it feels cohesive with the app's cultural purpose.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views authentication dialogs THEN the system SHALL style them to match the app's visual design language
2. WHEN a user interacts with Clerk components THEN the system SHALL display them with Spanish localization already configured
3. WHEN a user sees authentication dialogs THEN the system SHALL incorporate the app's color scheme and styling
4. WHEN a user completes authentication THEN the system SHALL close the dialog smoothly

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want protected routes to work seamlessly so that I can access my altars without authentication issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an unauthenticated user tries to access `/app` routes THEN the system SHALL redirect them to the landing page
2. WHEN an authenticated user accesses protected routes THEN the system SHALL allow access without additional prompts
3. WHEN a user completes authentication in a dialog THEN the system SHALL redirect them to the app dashboard
4. WHEN an unauthenticated user is redirected from protected routes THEN the system SHALL provide clear indication of why they were redirected

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user on the landing page, I want clear calls-to-action for authentication so that I know how to get started with the app.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an unauthenticated user views the landing page THEN the system SHALL show "Crear Mi Altar" button that opens sign-up dialog
2. WHEN an authenticated user views the landing page THEN the system SHALL show "Ir a Mis Altares" button that navigates to the app
3. WHEN a user clicks "Crear Mi Altar" THEN the system SHALL open the sign-up dialog
4. WHEN a user needs to sign in THEN the system SHALL provide a way to open the sign-in dialog from the landing page
